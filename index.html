    <h1>This is <strong>William Presswood</strong></h1>
    <p><em>Not long ago William was so overwhelmed with the idea of getting a job in software development that he completely froze
        once he graduated from University of Central Florida's Computer Science Program. This led him to waste his time shuttling food
        back and forth for ungrateful customers of the gig economy food delivery. At one point he said he had to change and decided to take
        his partner up on the offer of running their business from the admin side to give them time to focus more on the clients. After
        adjusting to this relativly big (to William it seemed humongous) change, he decided to do what was originally intended and work
        on his portfolio for his job search. After reviewing a few of the paid options of jumpstarting his web development projects, he 
        came across The Odin Project, which was an open source web dev training course. He felt this was going to be his best option and 
        quickly signed up and here we are, journeying into the unknown.</em>
